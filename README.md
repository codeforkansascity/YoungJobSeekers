The City of Kansas City, MO Health Department is engaging diverse communities across Kansas City through mobile outreach and the promotion of health-related resources.

## The Problem/Description
Currently, youth are connected to jobs by youth employment counselors from a variety of agencies. Many youth do not have reliable access to the internet and email to find jobs at home, at school, or at libraries, especially in areas with reduced funding for public services. There is often a significant difference in quantities of meaningful job opportunities between neighborhoods in urban areas and applicants in low-opportunity areas are likely to see a lower placement rate. To increase youth employment rates we need to develop a more equitable platform that all KC youth can access.

## What we need
We have experienced coders in the Brigade ready and willing to help. To incorporate the location and transit functions, we need people with a little more advanced skills. We would love to have designers and some front-end talent to work with the creative team so that the look and feel of the app is engaging to Kansas Cityâ€™s youth. And we have plenty of room for project managers, UX talent, marketing folks or others who find this use case compelling and are looking for a great project with which to give back to the community, learn new skills, or add a project to their portfolio.
